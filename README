A Youtube Video downloader. Meant for educational purpose.
Helps me download the long lecture videos, without having to watch it all.

Thought it would help me learn something new.

We get the download URL from parsing the html response we get when we execute a normal Youtube Video.

Used Java SWING to generate the UI.
This will allow the user to add 10 URLS, and download them.

Users have an option to change the download location.

The list of videos can be updated.

Note:
As of 2015 this application will not work. This can only be used for educational purposes. 
Youtube is forcing all access to videos using https. 
The application needs to satisfy the SSL handshake in order to access the youtube stream. 
It currently doesnt support this feature.
